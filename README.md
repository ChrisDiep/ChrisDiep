Hello! 

I'm a software engineer coming from a chemical engineering background with a passion for discovering how things work and making them better. Currently working on a site, [POEFlip](https://github.com/ChrisDiep/POE-Flip), for determining profitable currency trades in a virtual market. 

Feel free to reach out to me through e-mail, I would love to chat about any questions regarding my projects or other topics!
